The pronounced differences control sera elevated acute-phase proteins , notably haptoglobin , alpha1-antichymotrypsin , IgG , IgA , low serum albumin alpha2-HS-glycoprotein . Patients metachromatic class III presented pronounced rise acute-phase proteins , furthermore , significantly decreased complement C3 IgM , IgG IgA normal class III patients . These differences control sera possibly reflect inflammatory tissue damage involving immune reactions . The clinical score positively correlated radiologic score , scores positively correlated concentrations eight seven , respectively , serum proteins , negatively correlated three serum proteins .

SUPPORT-U-S-GOVT-P-H-S.We theorize cystic fibrosis may disease plasma factor lectin-like activity stimulates mucus secretion , causes precipitation mucus glycoproteins , incidentally affects lymphocytes culture . To confirm theory , planned search additional lectin-like activities CF serum . Our experiments suggest lectin-like substance CF blood requires IgM red-blood-cell-agglutination activity . Thus , difference agglutination titer observed CF homozygotes heterozygotes , IgM limiting factor , IgM concentrations differ appreciably subjects . We suspect CF homozygotes larger pool free lectin blood heterozygotes , quantitation free lectin pool may distinguish two phenotypes . Excess free lectin may account signs symptoms CF , whereas lesser amounts may theoretically advantageous heterozygote .", "79259": "Bohles-H. Heid-H. Stehr-K.
